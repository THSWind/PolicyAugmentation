# PolicyAugmentation


This repository includes the implementation code for the paper "Policy Augmentation: An Exploration Strategy for Faster Convergence of Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms" published in the 46th IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, & Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2021.

The code was developed based on the [Stable baselines](https://github.com/hill-a/stable-baselines) repository. The input and parameters of this code are all similar to the original repository Stable baseline.
